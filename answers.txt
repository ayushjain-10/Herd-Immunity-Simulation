1) What were the inputs you gave the simulation? 

Virus name, reproductive rate, mortality rate, Population size, 
percent vaccinated

Answer: "COVID", 0.25, 0.70, 250, 0.50 with 1 infected person to start


2) What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus
burned out?

Answer: 407 instances of infection resulted from 12,759 interactions, which means that 3.2% of interactions led to infection.
If we started with 250 people and 50% of them were vaccinated, that only left the potential for 125 to get infected.
Of those 125, 90 died, which is right around the mortality rate of COVID. 

3) What percentage of the population died from the virus?

Answer: 90 out of 250 died, which is 36%


4) Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many
total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially
becoming infected?

Answer: 9075
